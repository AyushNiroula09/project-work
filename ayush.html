<h2> <strong>Blog: My Journey and Aspirations</strong></h2>
<p>
Hello! My name is Ayush Niroula, and I'm going to let you in on a little bit about my life, and what are the things that I am passionate about. I'm in love with Computer Science and Mathematics. I love coding and solving tricky math problems,it’s like a puzzle that challenges me to think in different ways. Nevertheless, I am in a league of my own among school subjects. My dream to be a philanthropist is what motivates me the most.
I feel that the skills and knowledge that I’ve got I can actually accomplish what I dream of and help people. I am of the view that everything I learn should be used to help others—be it through creating new technology, extending educational opportunities, or even contributing to my community. My plan is to get my own business started one of these days but not just any business. I am interested in one that also helps people and makes the world a better place.
When I am not focused on my study or what lays ahead, I take pleasure in doing things like playing badminton, trying out new computer programs, and playing the ukulele. Badminton is good for me as it is a physical activity that keeps me active and allows me to clear my head out of academic stress. I also spend time on playing chess when I need to relieve stress and just enjoy some relaxing moments.
I know it will take time, but I am eager for the way ahead. I hope to be able to stick to the values I believe in, work hard, and at the end be in a position to give back in a tangible way that will change the life of the one who gets helped. Thank you for your reading.
