I enjoy exploring new places and meeting people from different background and listening to their stories.Personally, my family and my community means a lot to me because it’s where I find support, friendship, and opportunities to make a difference.
I enjoy volunteering in my community, as it allows me to connect with others and contribute positively. I believe that every experience, whether big or small, teaches us something valuable.
 These experiences not only allow me to connect with others but also teach me the importance of empathy and teamwork.My interactions with diverse people in my community inspire me to learn more about their stories and perspectives, which enriches my own life. 
My goal is to be a positive force in my community, using my voice and skills to inspire change and foster a spirit of togetherness and unity.
